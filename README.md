- 👋 Hi, I’m @j2blue
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of things, but in this special case learning how to improve my coding and scripting skills
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub and code management, along with some newer web tools
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Nothing until I learn how to ride the damn bike first
- 📫 How to reach me: telepathically for now.
